# racktables-docker

## Quickstart

Note that this isn't a production setup, but fairly close. Make sure to change
the configuration if you intend to use it in production.
```sh
    docker-compose up
```
    # Start by browsing to https://localhost:8000/?module=installer&step=5

## Configuration

Look at the env vars available in the `Dockerfile` and `entrypoint.sh`.
